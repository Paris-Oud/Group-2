# Problem Definition

## Definition of the Problem
The Relationship Managers (RMs) require operational assistance in the in-house call management centre (CMC) to serve their end-customers based according to the RMs’ experience and customers profiles. Currently, the system operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company.

## Objectives
* Create an information system which improves the operation of the call flow rate management centre(CMC) in providing service from customers to relationship managers (RM) through criteria based call flow control and improved call routing. 

* The information system will give a score to RM’s based on a questionnaire, with the score adjusting based on factors such as the effectiveness of serving customers and future performance. The questionnaire also will create a ‘target list’ based on their skills and profile which lists potential customers and suitable holiday packages to be sold from RM’s. The system should also match Customers to RM's based on the difficulty of the task as well as specific criteria based on the customers’ information such as surname and postcode.

* Outbound calls will be generated automatically via a system-generated customer target list which utilises customer details from a database, displaying to the RM a script and guideline assisting the manager in providing end-customer service. The outbound calls will be taken by RM’s with similar skill and cultural factors.

* Inbound calls will reach the call management centre (CMC) which is then routed via its own private branch exchange. The identified ‘score’ of the customer will match an RM which will help increase sales.
