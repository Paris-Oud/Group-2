# Problem Definition

## Definition of the Problem
The Relationship Managers (RMs) require operational assistance in the in-house call management centre (CMC) to serve their end-customers based according to the RMs’ experience and customers profiles. Currently, the system operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company.

## Objectives
* Create an information system which improves the operation of the call flow rate management centre(CMC) in providing service from customers to relationship managers (RM) through criteria based call flow control and improved call routing. 

* The information system will give a score to RM’s based on a questionnaire, with the score adjusting based on factors such as the effectiveness of serving customers and future performance. The questionnaire also will create a ‘target list’ based on their skills and profile which lists potential customers and suitable holiday packages to be sold from RM’s. The system should also match Customers to RM's based on the difficulty of the task as well as specific criteria based on the customers’ information such as surname and postcode.

* Outbound calls will be generated automatically via a system-generated customer target list which utilises customer details from a database, displaying to the RM a script and guideline assisting the manager in providing end-customer service. The outbound calls will be taken by RM’s with similar skill and cultural factors.

* Inbound calls will reach the call management centre (CMC) which is then routed via its own private branch exchange. The identified ‘score’ of the customer will match an RM which will help increase sales.

# Design Thinking Approach to address the problem

## Reflection

### Design Thinking Process

#### Stage 1 - Empathy
This process allowed us to view the system from the perspective of the customer and the RM giving us a better idea of what the needs and wants of the stakeholders are (see Appendix TBA). We noticed a general negative outlook on the time wasting call process.

We found that customers were not satisfied with the core process of the call management system as there were long waits with the customers being paired with less suitable relationship managers. As shown in the POV statements (see below) , customers were also more inclined to utilise online services as inbound calling resulted in longer wait times.

We also noticed that the RM’s work was less efficient with more unsuccessful sales as the managers were paired up with customers less likely to purchase the holiday packages. RM’s noticed that their competitors were able to make more sales due to their easier to use processes.From the ‘How Might We’ statements (see below), managers believed that having some automated voice response systems for less important tasks will help improve the call flow rate.


#### Stage 2 - Define
Through empathizing with the customers and the RM’s, we can see that the call management system needs improvement on shortening the wait times for inbound calls as well as increasing call efficiency. This will increase customer and RM satisfaction and improve the call flow rate.

## Competitive Advantages
The improvements to the Call Management Centres call flow rate implemented by the information system will give the travel company competitive advantage against competitors due to the increased efficiency of Relationship Managers packager sames as well as improving the effectiveness of customer service. 

The efficiency of the service is improved through the system prioritising customers with a higher likelihood of making a purchase based on factors such as whether they are repeat customers. This makes the system more efficient as customers will be more likely to make purchases more quickly as they are prioritised. Additionally, other factors such as their postal code which could be included in the customer questionnaire may be used to also create priority. The competitive advantage for this is the company potentially having more sales per call than their competitors

The effectiveness of the service is improving through the ‘profiler tool’ system which will pair up a customer with a suitable relationship manager based on criteria. This will allow for the Relationship Managers to better understand the customer as they will be matched based on cultural and social factors, leading to better communication between the two parties, improving the likelihood of sales being made. This gives the company an advantage against competitors as it is offering tailored service to customers improving customer relations as well as increasing the company reputation.

Overall, the improvements to the system will offer significant competitive advantage against rival companies due to the projected increase in efficiency and effectiveness of the Call Management Centre.

## Possible Effects if the project fails
If the project fails, consumers may mistrust the company's profiling tool and the call management centre overall and be more likely to use alternative service. Additionally, none of the issues gathered during the Design Thinking Process will be resolved.

Mistrust of the call management centre may hinder any future technical changes made by the company as consumers will mistrust the system, making it harder for them to accept the changes and therefore make them less inclined to complete mandatory prerequisites to using the system. An example of this is the questionnaire, which is required for the profiling tool to help match customers with suitable managers.

Due to the Design Thinking Process issues not being resolved, customers will remain unsatisfied with the time inefficiency and lack of quality service in the system, likely switching to an alternative option.
